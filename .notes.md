npm install hardhat --save-dev

npm install --global hardhat-shorthand

copy/pasta .env, .gitignore, .notes.md, .prettierrc, package.json, and README.md

maybe try this next

or just
`yarn`
instead of that huge mess

create new folder

> compile basic contract

install openzeppelin
`yarn add --dev @openzeppelin/contracts`

import ERC721 into base nft contract
`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";`

use course hosted ipfs link for nft URI
`ipfs://bafybeig37ioir76s7mg5oobetncojcm3c3hxasyd4rvid4jqhy4gkaheg4/?filename=0-PUG.json`
write functions to mint the dog nft(no limit), see counter, and see URI as both variables are private

to mint an NFT, we will trigger a Chainlink VRF call to get us a random number
using that number will get a random nft
choice are Pug, Shiba Inu, St Bernard
Pug: Super Rare
Shiba: sort of rare
St Bernard: common

users must pay to mint
only owner can withdraw

to use VRF
`yarn add --dev @chainlink/contracts`
and import coordinator and base

need VRFCoordinator interface to be given address which we pass in the constructor and make it immutable

nft variables such as mint price, nftId which we will update per mint and keeps track of VRF responses using requestId mapping to address in order to determine RNG

write error if less than mint price sent

requestNft will not mint, will only trigger request to VRF

VRF response in fulfillRandomWords (uint256[] randomWords) used AFTER \_safeMint for RNG
mapping of the requestId to VRF is the minter
and the counter we increment is the tokenId

    function getBreedFromModdedRng(uint256 moddedRng) public pure return(Breed) {
    	uint256 cumulativeSum = 0;
    	uint256[3] memory chanceArray = getChanceArray();
    	// assume moddedRng = 25
    	// i = 0
    	// cumaltiveSum = 0
    	// 25 is not less than 10 (chanceArray[i])
    	// i = 1
    	// cumaltiveSum = 10
    	// 25 is greater than 10 AND 25 is less than 40
    	for(uint256 i = 0; i < chanceArray.length(); i++) {
    		if (moddedRng >= cumulativeSum && moddedRng < cumulativeSum + chanceArray[i]) {
    			return Breed(i);
    		}
    		cumulativeSum += chanceArray[i];
    	}
    }

    function getChanceArray() public pure returns(uint256[3] memory) {
    	return [10, 30, MAX_CHANCE_VALUE]; // index 1 has 20% and index 2 has 60%

swapped out ERC721.sol for ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol
use of same constructor as ERC721URIStorage extens ERC721
more cutomizations to set URI, more gas expensive

remove tokenUri since we are using URIStorage to call \_setTokenURI per mint

import ownable and set the modifier for the withdraw function
add withdraw function
uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
(bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
if (!success) {
revert RandomIpfsNft\_\_TransferFailed();
}

tokenUri saved in string array, values passed in through constructor
breed enum that was determined with the VRF passed in as index of the URI string for the setURI function in the extended ERC721URIStorage
